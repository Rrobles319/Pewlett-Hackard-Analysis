## Project Overview 
The Pewlett Hackard Company has indentified an opportunity in the mass retirement of some of their most knowledgeable and tenured workforce. In anticipation of the "silver tsunami", Pewlett Hackard would like to gain a better understanding of how much of ther work will be retiring in the near future and create a mentorship program to develop current talent. Pewlett Hackard would like to know the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
By creating a database to analyze the given data, the following determinations were made:

1. By department, the Development team is facing the most turnover with 9,281 upcoming retirees.
2.

3. When assesing the greatest opportunity for upcoming entry level roles (engineering or staff),the engineering department will have the most upcoming open roles (14,222) to fill.
4. When assesing the greatest opportunity for upcoming senior level roles (engineering or staff),the engineering department again will have the most upcoming open roles (29,414) to fill.





## Summary 
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, there will be 90,398 role will have to be replaced. In stark contrast, only 1,940 of these retirement ready employees have been deemed eligible for the mentorship program.
