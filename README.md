# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

## Project Overview 
The Pewlett Hackard Company has indentified an opportunity in the mass retirement of some of their most knowledgeable and tenured workforce. In anticipation of the "silver tsunami", Pewlett Hackard would like to gain a better understanding of how much of ther work will be retiring in the near future and create a mentorship program to develop current talent. Pewlett Hackard would like to know the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
By creating a database to analyze the given data, the following determinations were made:

1. By department, the Development team is facing the most turnover with 9,281 upcoming retirees.

2. Of the 90,398 employees ready for retirement, 
  - 14,222 are engineers 
  - 1,761 are assistant engineers
  - 29,414 are senior engineers
  - 45,397 total engineers

3. Of the 90,398, employees ready for retirement, only 1,940 (abt 2%) are eligible for the mentorship program.

4. Of the 1,940 employees eligible for mentorship, 
  - 513 are engineers 
  - 78 are assistant engineers
  - 346 are senior engineers
  - 937 total engineers




## Summary 
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, there will be 90,398 role will have to be replaced. In stark contrast, only 1,940 of these retirement ready employees have been deemed eligible for the mentorship program. At the time of this analysis, Pewlett Hackard does not have an adequate number of employees eligible for the upcoming mass retirement. Going forward, Pewlett Hackard may want to consider placing more priority on succession planning, especially in regards to the engineering team's volume of upcoming turnover. The following image and query break down mentor eligibility by title.
